# Evaluating Node Ordering Effects on Large Language Model Graph Reasoning

This repository contains the implementation and results for the project:

**"Evaluating Node Ordering Effects on Large Language Model Graph Reasoning: A Systematic Analysis"**

The project investigates how **node ordering in graph representations** impacts the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on algorithmic graph reasoning tasks.  
Experiments are conducted with **Llama 3.2** and **Gemma 3:12B**, using various prompt configurations (unordered, ordered, ordered with explanation).
